=========================
GTK Irregular Shaped Form
=========================

This code is just my experiment to create irregular shaped form using GTK. I'm sharing this code
for those who are looking for this kind of approach in displaying their GTK forms. Feel free to
fork and do whatever you like with this code and feel free to share it back with me. I'm
also open for any suggestion or pull request to upgrade this sample code.

Happy coding!
